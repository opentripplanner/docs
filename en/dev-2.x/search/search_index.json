Its server component runs on any platform with a Java virtual machine (including Linux, Mac, and Windows). It exposes REST and GraphQL APIs that can be accessed by various clients including open source Javascript components and native mobile applications. It builds its representation of the transportation network from open data in open standard file formats (primarily GTFS and OpenStreetMap). It applies real-time updates and alerts with immediate visibility to clients, finding itineraries that account for disruptions and service changes. OTP is released under the LGPL license. As of 2020, the codebase has been in active development for over ten years, and is relied upon by transportation authorities and travel planning applications in deployments around the world.</p> <p>You are currently reading the documentation for OpenTripPlanner 2, the second major version of OTP.</p>"},{"location":"#versions-of-this-documentation","title":"Versions of this documentation","text":"<p>Several versions of this documentation are built and published automatically for different branches of OTP.

There's an excellent description of the GTFS format here. Transport agencies throughout the world provide GTFS schedules to the public. Transitland has a registry of feeds and TransitFeeds also provides an extensive catalog. The best option is often to simply fetch the data directly from a transit operator or agency. If you know of a feed you want to work with, download it and put it in an empty directory you have created for your OTP instance such as <code>/home/username/otp</code> on Linux, <code>/Users/username/otp</code> on MacOS, or <code>C:\\Users\\username\\otp</code> on Windows. For OTP2 to detect a GTFS file, its name must end in <code>.zip</code> and must contain the letters 'gtfs'. We often use the convention of saving GTFS files with names ending in <code>.gtfs.zip</code> which meets both these criteria, reflecting the fact that a GTFS feed is just a ZIP file containing a specific set of files. If you don't have a particular feed in mind, the one for Portland, Oregon's TriMet agency is a good option. It is available at this URL. This is a moderate-sized input of good quality (TriMet initiated OTP development and helped develop the GTFS format). On Linux, this could be done on the command line as follows:</p> <pre><code>$ cd /home/username\n$ mkdir otp\n$ cd otp\n$ wget \"http://developer.trimet.org/schedule/gtfs.zip\" -O trimet.gtfs.zip\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Basic-Tutorial/#osm-for-streets","title":"OSM for Streets","text":"<p>You'll also need OpenStreetMap data to build a road network for walking, cycling, and driving. OpenStreetMap is a global collaborative map database that rivals or surpasses the quality of commercial maps in many locations. Several services extract smaller geographic regions from this database. Interline Technologies maintains a collection of extracts updated daily for urban areas around the world . Geofabrik provides extracts for larger areas like countries or states, from which you can prepare your own smaller bounding-box extracts using Osmosis , osmconvert, or (our favorite) Osmium-Tool. OSM data can be delivered as XML or in the more compact binary PBF format. OpenTripPlanner consumes only PBF because it's smaller and more efficient.</p> <p>Download OSM PBF data for the same geographic region as your GTFS feed, and place this PBF file in the same directory you created for the OSM data. If you are using the TriMet GTFS feed, you could download the Geofabrik extract for the US state of Oregon , then further trim that to just the TriMet service area using the bounding box switch of one of the above tools. On Linux or MacOS you could do that as follows:</p> <pre><code>$ cd /home/username\n$ wget http://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us/oregon-latest.osm.pbf\n$ osmconvert oregon-latest.osm.pbf -b=-123.043,45.246,-122.276,45.652 --complete-ways -o=portland.pbf\n$ mv portland.pbf otp\n</code></pre> <p>We find this tool useful for determining the geographic coordinates of bounding boxes. The CSV option in that tool produces exactly the format expected by the <code>osmconvert -b</code> switch. The <code>--complete-ways</code> switch is important to handle roads that cross outside your bounding box.</p> <p>If you have extracted a smaller PBF file from a larger region, be sure to put only your extract (not the original larger file) in the directory with your GTFS data. Otherwise OTP will try to load both the original file and the extract in a later step. See the page on preparing OSM data for additional information and example commands for cropping and filtering OSM data.</p>"},{"location":"Basic-Tutorial/#starting-otp","title":"Starting OTP","text":"<p>A typical command to start OTP looks like <code>java -Xmx2G -jar otp.shaded.jar &lt;options&gt;</code>. The <code>-Xmx</code> parameter sets the limit on how much memory OTP is allowed to consume. GTFS and OSM data sets are often very large, and OTP is relatively memory-hungry. You will need at least 1GB of memory when working with the Portland TriMet data set, and several gigabytes for larger inputs. If you have sufficient memory in your computer, set this to a couple of gigabytes (e.g. <code>-Xmx2G</code>). Java uses a garbage collection approach to memory management, which requires some \"breathing room\" to efficiently operate. Without sufficient free memory OTP can grind to a halt. VisualVM is a good way to inspect Java memory usage, especially with the VisualGC plugin.</p>"},{"location":"Basic-Tutorial/#building-graphs","title":"Building Graphs","text":"<p>There are two main phases to preparing and deploying an OTP server. The first is to analyze the GTFS, OSM and any other inputs (such as elevation data) and build a representation of the transportation network. Following mathematical terminology we call this a 'graph', and refer to this phase as \"graph building\". The second phase is to start a server that provides trip planning and other API services for this graph.</p> <p>It is possible to save the graph to a file on disk after the first phase, then load the graph from the file in the second phase. This allows restarting the server or starting multiple instances of the server without repeating the often time-consuming process of building the graph. It is also possible to split the graph building process into separate OSM and GTFS stages for similar reasons: to allow reusing results from slow processes, such as applying elevation data to streets. These different options are controlled with command line switches, and will be described in more detail below and in other tutorials.</p>"},{"location":"Basic-Tutorial/#simple-one-step-server","title":"Simple One-step Server","text":"<p>The simplest way to use OTP is to build a graph in a single step and start a server immediately, without saving it to disk. The command to do so is:</p> <pre><code>$ java -Xmx2G -jar otp-2.2.0-shaded.jar --build --serve /home/username/otp\n</code></pre> <p>where <code>/home/username/otp</code> should be the directory where you put your configuration and input files.</p> <p>If you're using the Portland input data, the graph build operation should take about one minute to complete, and then you'll see a <code>Grizzly server running</code> message. At this point you have an OpenTripPlanner server running locally and can open http://localhost:8080/ in a web browser. You should be presented with a Javascript client application that will interact with your local OpenTripPlanner instance.</p> <p>This map-based user interface is in fact sending HTTP GET requests to the OTP server running on your local machine. It can be informative to watch the HTTP requests and responses being generated using the developer tools in your web browser. OTP's built-in web server will run by default on ports 8080 and 8081 for HTTP and HTTPS respectively. If by any chance some other software is already using one or both of those port numbers, you can specify different port numbers with switches like <code>--port 8801 --securePort 8802</code>.</p>"},{"location":"Basic-Tutorial/#saving-a-graph","title":"Saving a Graph","text":"<p>If you want speed up the process of repeatedly starting up a server with the same graph, you can build a graph from street and transit data then save it to a file using the <code>--build</code> and <code>--save</code> command line parameters together. If for example your current working directory (<code>.</code>) contains the input files and the OTP JAR file, you can use this command:</p> <pre><code>$ java -Xmx2G -jar otp-2.2.0-shaded.jar --build --save .\n</code></pre> <p>This will produce a file called <code>graph.obj</code> in the same directory as the inputs. The server can then be started later using the <code>--load</code> parameter, and will read this file instead of building the graph from scratch:</p> <pre><code>$ java -Xmx2G -jar otp-2.2.0-shaded.jar --load .\n</code></pre> <p>Another reason to perform these two phases separately is that the building process loads the entire GTFS and OSM data sets into memory, so can require significantly more memory than just running a server. Accordingly, you may want to perform the build on one machine (e.g. a throw-away cloud instance with more memory or compute capacity), then copy the resulting graph file to one or more smaller machines to serve the API.</p>"},{"location":"Basic-Tutorial/#layering-gtfs-onto-osm","title":"Layering GTFS onto OSM","text":"<p>Building the street graph (especially with elevation data) can take a long time. It is common for transit data to change more frequently than street data, so it can be convenient to build the street graph once, and then layer transit data on top of the streets to make the final graph.</p> <p>Again assuming the input files and OTP JAR file are in the current working directory, you can build a street graph with OSM and elevation data only (ignoring transit input files) with this command:</p> <pre><code>$ java -Xmx2G -jar otp-2.2.0-shaded.jar --buildStreet .\n</code></pre> <p>Then, to build a graph layering transit data on top of the saved street graph (built using the previous command):</p> <pre><code>$ java -Xmx2G -jar otp-2.2.0-shaded.jar --loadStreet --save .\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, the server can be started using the <code>--load</code> parameter:</p> <pre><code>$ java -Xmx2G -jar otp-2.2.0-shaded.jar --load .\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Basic-Tutorial/#command-line-switches","title":"Command Line Switches","text":"<p>The flow diagram below summarizes all the command line switches used in the above examples, and how they control which actions are taken when OTP starts up.</p> <p></p> <p>You must use at least one of the required parameters: <code>--load</code>, <code>--loadStreet</code>, <code>--build</code> , <code>--buildStreet</code>.

Walk-only and bicycle-only trips are generally planned using the A-star algorithm with a Euclidean heuristic. Walk+Transit or Bike+Transit trips are planned using A-star with the Tung-Chew heuristic (i.e. a graph grown backward from the destination providing a lower bound on aggregate weight) for queue ordering. For speed reasons we are performing single-variable generalized cost optimization, which is not ideal. We should be performing Pareto optimization on at least two variables (generalized cost and time).</p> <p>OTP2 splits the search into three segments: access from the origin to transit stops, egress from transit stops to the destination, and transit service connecting the two. For the transit segment, OTP2 uses the Multi-criteria Range Raptor algorithm. For the access and egress searches it uses the same approach as OTP1. Both splitting the search into three parts and use of a table-scanning algorithm like Raptor improve OTP2's performance significantly while increasing result quality by producing true Pareto-optimal sets of results.</p>"},{"location":"Bibliography/#algorithms-used-in-otp2-but-not-otp1","title":"Algorithms used in OTP2 but not OTP1","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Delling, Pajor, Werneck.

This affects both GTFS service calendars and dates. The service calendar is reduced and dates outside the period are dropped. OTP2 will compute a transit schedule for every day for which it can find at least one trip running. On the other hand, OTP will waste resources if a service end date is unbounded or very large (<code>9999-12-31</code>). To avoid this, limit the OTP service period. Also, if you provide a service with multiple feeds they may have different service end dates. To avoid inconsistent results, the period can be limited, so all feeds have data for the entire period. The default is to use a period of 1 year before, and 3 years after the day the graph is built. Limiting the period will not improve the search performance, but OTP will build faster and load faster in most cases.</p> <p>The <code>transitServiceStart</code> and <code>transitServiceEnd</code> parameters are set using an absolute date like <code>2020-12-31</code> or a period like <code>P1Y6M5D</code> relative to the graph build date.

In systems where the subway is quite deep and transfers happen via tunnels, the time required for an in-station transfer is often less than that for a surface transfer.</p> <p>One way to resolve this problem is by ensuring that the GTFS feed codes each platform as a separate stop, then micro-mapping stations in OSM. When OSM data contains a detailed description of walkways, stairs, and platforms within a station, GTFS stops can be linked to the nearest platform and transfers will happen via the OSM ways, which should yield very realistic transfer time expectations. This works particularly well in above-ground train stations where the layering of non-intersecting ways is less prevalent.

At a global scale sea level is represented as a surface called the geoid, which is irregular in shape due to local gravitational anomalies. On the other hand, GPS elevations are reported relative to the WGS84 spheroid, a perfectly smooth mathematical surface approximating the geoid. In cases where the two elevation definitions are mixed, it may be necessary to adjust elevation values to avoid confusing users with things like negative elevation values in places clearly above sea level. See issue #2301 for detailed discussion of this.</p> <p>OTP allows you to adjust the elevation values reported in API responses in two ways. The first way is to store ellipsoid (GPS) elevation values internally, but apply a single geoid difference value in the OTP client where appropriate to display elevations above sea level. This ellipsoid to geoid difference is returned in each trip plan response in the ElevationMetadata field. Using a single value can be sufficient for smaller OTP deployments, but might result in incorrect values at the edges of larger OTP deployments. If your OTP instance uses this, it is recommended to set a default request value in the <code>router-config.json</code> file as follows:</p> <pre><code>// router-config.json\n{\n\"routingDefaults\": {\n\"geoidElevation\": true   }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The second way is to precompute these geoid difference values at a more granular level and store all elevations internally relative to the geoid (sea level). Elevations returned in the API responses will then not need to be adjusted to match end users' intuitive understanding of elevation. In order to speed up calculations, these geoid difference values are calculated and cached using only 2 significant digits of GPS coordinates. This is more than enough detail for most regions of the world and should result in less than one meter of vertical error even in areas that have the largest geoid irregularities. To enable this, include the following in the <code>build-config.json</code> file:</p> <pre><code>// build-config.json\n{\n\"includeEllipsoidToGeoidDifference\": true\n}\n</code></pre> <p>If the geoid difference values are precomputed, be careful to not set the routing resource value of <code>geoidElevation</code> to true in order to avoid having the graph-wide geoid added again to all elevation values in the relevant street edges in responses.</p>"},{"location":"BuildConfiguration/#other-raster-elevation-data","title":"Other raster elevation data","text":"<p>For other parts of the world you will need a GeoTIFF file containing the elevation data.

If you will be modifying OTP you will need to know how to rebuild it (though your IDE may take care of this build cycle for you). If you have the right software installed, building OTP locally from its source code is not particularly difficult. You should only need the following software:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Git, a version control system</p> </li> <li> <p>Java Development Kit, preferably version 11</p> </li> <li> <p>Maven, a build and dependency management system</p> </li> </ul> <p>You will also need a reliable internet connection so Maven can fetch all of OTP's dependencies (the libraries it uses).</p> <p>Once you have these packages installed, create and/or switch to the directory where you will keep your Git repositories and make a local copy of the OTP source code:</p> <pre><code>mkdir git\ncd git\ngit clone git@github.com:opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner.git\n</code></pre> <p>Then change to the newly cloned OpenTripPlanner repository directory and start a build:</p> <pre><code>cd OpenTripPlanner\nmvn clean package\n</code></pre> <p>Maven should then be able to download all the libraries and other dependencies necessary to compile OTP. If all goes well you should see a success message like the following:</p> <pre><code>[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Total time: 42.164s\n[INFO] Finished at: Tue Feb 18 19:35:48 CET 2014\n[INFO] Final Memory: 88M/695M\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</code></pre> <p>This build process should produce a JAR file called <code>otp-x.y.z-shaded.jar</code> in the <code>target/</code> directory which contains all the compiled OTP classes and their dependencies (the external libraries they use). The shell script called 'otp' in the root of the cloned repository will start the main class of that JAR file under a Java virtual machine, so after the Maven build completes you should be able to run <code>./otp --help</code> and see an OTP help message including command line options. Due to the way Maven works, this script is not executable by default, so you will need to do <code>chmod u+x ./otp</code> before you run it to mark it as executable.</p> <p>The words \"clean package\" are the build steps you want to run. You're telling maven to clean up any extraneous junk in the directory, then perform all the build steps, including compilation, up to and including \"package\", which bundles the compiled program into a single JAR file for distribution.</p> <p>If you have just cloned OTP you will be working with the default \"master\" branch, where most active development occurs. This is not the most stable or deployment-ready code available. To avoid newly minted bugs or undocumented behavior, you can use Git to check out a specific release (tag or branch) of OTP to work with. The Maven build also includes many time-consuming integration tests. When working with a stable release of OTP, you may want to turn them off by adding the switch: <code>-DskipTests</code>.</p> <p>For example, you could do the following:</p> <pre><code>cd OpenTripPlanner\ngit checkout v2.2.0\ngit clean -df\nmvn clean package -DskipTests\n</code></pre> <p>Please note that the build process creates two distinct versions of the OTP JAR file. The one ending in <code>-shaded.jar</code> is much bigger because it contains copies of all the external libraries that OTP uses. It serves as a stand-alone runnable distribution of OTP. The one with a version number but without the word <code>shaded</code> contains only OTP itself, without any external dependencies.

From 2009 through 2012, development was coordinated by New York nonprofit OpenPlans. In 2011 a second workshop was held to mark the end of the first phase of development. TriMet's 2009-2011 OTP Final Report summarizes progress at that point.</p> <p>The project has since grown to encompass a global community of users and developers. By early 2013, OpenTripPlanner had become the primary trip planning software used by TriMet in the Portland regional trip planner and was backing several popular mobile applications. Public-facing OpenTripPlanner instances were available in at least ten countries throughout the world. At this point the OpenPlans transportation software team became the independent consultancy Conveyal. The original OpenTripPlanner development team from OpenPlans still actively participates in programming, design, and community coordination via the mailing list and their roles on the OTP Project Leadership Committee.</p> <p>In summer of 2013, the OpenTripPlanner project was accepted for membership in the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC). SFC handles the legal and financial details common to many open source projects.</p> <p>In 2013-2014 OpenTripPlanner was a focal point in the Dutch Transport Ministry's Beter Benutten Multimodale Reisinformatie (Better Utilization: Multimodal Travel Information) project which encouraged investment in trip planning platforms and services. Five companies worked together to improve OpenTripPlanner performance in large regional transport networks and add support for streaming real-time data, making itineraries reflect service modifications and delays only seconds after vehicles report their positions. Another consortium embarked on a full rewrite of the trip planning core called RRRR (or R4), a proof of concept validating extremely efficient routing techniques and serving as an early prototype for OTP2.</p> <p>In the fall of 2014, Arlington, Virginia launched a new commute planning site for the Washington, DC metropolitan area, depending on OpenTripPlanner to weigh the costs and benefits of various travel options. In 2015 the New York State department of transportation's 511 transit trip planner began using OTP to provide itineraries for public transit systems throughout the state from a single unified OTP instance. Starting in early 2016, the regional transport authorities of Helsinki, Finland (HSL) and Oslo, Norway (Ruter) began using a completely open source passenger information system based on OpenTripPlanner. National-scale OpenTripPlanner instances were also created in Finland and Norway.</p> <p>After seven years of hard work and almost 10,000 commits from over 100 contributors around the world, OTP version 1.0 was released on 9 September 2016.</p>"},{"location":"History/#opentripplanner-2","title":"OpenTripPlanner 2","text":"<p>The OTP community has a long history with round-based routing algorithms. FivePoints, one of the predecessor projects to OTP, used a round-based method several years before the now-familiar Raptor algorithm was published in an influential paper . OpenPlans carried out experiments with routing innovations like Raptor and contraction hierarchies as they emerged in the academic literature. Research and development work on OTP scalability has focused on round-based tabular approaches since the MMRI pre-commercial procurement projects of 2013-2014. Conveyal built its high-performance transportation network analysis system around its R5 router. So in strategy discussions, the expected technical direction was clear.</p> <p>In the second quarter of 2018, Ruter and Entur took the lead on finally integrating a new round-based transit routing engine inspired by R5 into OTP. They also began adding support for importing EU-standard Netex data, making it possible for passenger information services in Europe to achieve regulatory compliance with a fully open source software stack. In June 2018, at the first OTP international summit hosted by Cambridge Systematics in Boston, the project leadership committee officially approved this roadmap toward OTP2.</p> <p>In April of 2019, the second OTP international summit was hosted by Entur in Oslo. Encouraged by the crowd of participants from across the Nordic countries and North America, work on OTP2 continued unabated through 2019, 2020, and 2021 with twice-weekly videoconferences bringing together software developers from across the world.

For example, true geographic islands are usually disconnected from the main graph. The street network of such islands should be kept so that routing within the island or continuing from a ferry stop on it works as expected. Even a tiny street network connected to a ferry stop improves routing to an island a lot, because coordinate based itinerary searches find something to project onto.</p> <p> Removing a small subgraph from an island causes poor routing. A ferry stop on the island links directly to mainland.</p> <p>Disconnected part can also represent a strictly forbidden area, such as connections within an industrial unit, roads of a military base or another region which cannot and should not be accessed when using door to door routing of a public transit journey planner. Existence of such graph sections is harmful, because start and end points of an itinerary search request may accidentally get projected to such a private pathway. As a result, user does not receive any itineraries and gets no explanation for the routing problem.</p> <p>In most cases, connectivity problems are caused by incorrect modeling of OSM data. The number of such errors is usually very large, and the problem cannot be solved  by simply fixing OSM data as soon as errors  get detected. The OSM street network in Finland contains over 10 000 detected walk connectivity issues. An algorithmic solution is needed to address a problem of such magnitude.</p> <p> A typical error: bus platforms are not connected to the street network at all</p> <p>A simple and efficient solution is to detect harmful disconnected parts and remove them from the street graph. Routing then uses the properly connected part of the graph and finds itineraries. As a side effect, the start point of an itinerary search which departs from the removed graph projects at the border of it, which usually is good enough. Transfers may include strange teleportation and unexpected walking, as public transit stops may link to somewhat remote streets, but at least transfers will work.</p> <p> A disconnected railway platform breaks routing. Traveler is guided to take a round trip around the country although there is one hour direct train connection.</p>"},{"location":"IslandPruning/#access-restriction-islands","title":"Access restriction islands","text":"<p>One common reason for OSM connectivity problems is access tagging. It is perfectly OK to tag a front yard of a private residence using access=private or access=destination tags, so that strangers are not guided to travel through the private area. Routing will still use the private streets if a trip starts or ends there - only pass through traversal gets prohibited. However, sometimes OSM contributors try to block the traffic by tagging only entrance segments of streets leading to a restricted area. Unfortunately this totally prevents access to the interior part of the network, because OTP interprets it as pass through traffic. Pruning handles such problems by converting streets behind an access restriction to have the same access properties.</p> <p> Some regular (gray colored) streets are blocked behind access restricted (red colored) connections. Walk routing to them fails because it would be considered as pass through traffic. The image on the right shows that pruning added walk nothrough restricition to those streets, and routing works again.</p>"},{"location":"IslandPruning/#pruning-algorithm","title":"Pruning algorithm","text":"<p>Pruning analyses the three traverse modes - walk, bike and car - separately. For example, a resting area by a motorway may include some walking paths, but the only way to get there is to use car. Therefore, it represents a disconnected 'island' when considering the walk mode. Pruning does not erase disconnected graph geometry as long as it can be reached using any of the traverse modes. Instead, pruning removes traversal permission for each disconnected mode from the island.</p> <p>Pruning uses four parameters and some heuristics to decide if a disconnected sub graph is a real island to be retained, or a harmulf data error:</p> <ul> <li><code>islandWithStopsMaxSize</code> defines the threshold for graph islands, which include public transit stops. All stop islands which have less graph edges than this get pruned. Default value is 2.  </li> <li><code>islandWithoutStopsMaxSize</code> defines the threshold for graph islands, which do not have public transit stops. All stopless islands which have less edges than this get pruned. Defaults to 10.  </li> <li><code>adaptivePruningFactor</code> defines the maximal value for a distance based multiplier for the two thresholds defined above (default value 20).  </li> <li><code>adaptivePruningDistance</code> defines the search radius as meters when estimating distance between graphs (default value 250).  </li> </ul> <p>Pruning thresholds are increased adaptively so that if the distance between an examined sub graph and the other graph is zero, the threshold is multiplied by a full adaptivePruningFactor value. The idea is that if a sub graph is closely entangled with another graph, it is likely to be a harmful modeling error, not a remote place like a true geographic island. If distance is more than adaptivePruningDistance, the actual nominal threshold values will be used. So, adaptiveness prunes much larger disconnected graphs in places where they have potential to cause routing errors.</p> <p>Adaptive pruning can be disabled by setting adaptivePruningFactor to 1. Constant pruning thresholds will then be applied.</p> <p>Pruning also examines the transport modes of graph islands with stops. If land transportation modes are not found (only ferry or no modes at all), the graph is retained. Unknown mode is accepted for island status, because ferry lines often operate only during warm seasons.</p>"},{"location":"IslandPruning/#some-examples","title":"Some examples","text":"<p> A disconnected small graph should be preserved, if it is located on a real island.</p> <p> A street section has tags which prevent traversal on it, and OTP has removed it from the graph. Some isolated streets remain left, and a public transit stop gets linked to them. Routing cannot use the stop unless traveler is leaving from or going to the small isolated sub graph. Isolated streets cannot be reached by walking either. After pruning, the stop is projected to the main graph. Transfers at the stop work fine. Itineraries can guide traveler quite close to the removed streets.</p> <p> The platform structure of a bus station is disconnected from the other graph. Most bus traffic of a medium size city becomes unusable.

Such islands are particularly harmful, because they are places where public transit transfers take place and hence are frequently used.

Netex is a European specification for transit data exchange, comparable in purpose to GTFS but broader in scope. An EU directive aims to have all EU countries sharing Netex data by the end of 2019.</p> <p>Different countries are currently using different incompatible \"profiles\" of Netex, but an effort is underway to converge on a single European standard profile. This is based in large part on the Norwegian profile, and Norway's national passenger information and ticketing agency Entur has contributed the OTP2 Netex loading code. Therefore if you'd like to try loading Netex data, Norway is a good place to start.</p> <p>The Norwegian Netex data can be downloaded from the Entur developer pages. There is a column of Netex download links partway down the page, and the first row is for all of Norway.</p> <p>Full OSM data for Norway can be downloaded from the Geofabrik Norway downloads page. Get the <code>norway-latest.osm.pbf</code> file, which can then be filtered to remove buildings and other unused data before loading into OTP using a command like the one below. This filtering step can be skipped if you don't have the necessary Osmium tools installed.</p> <p><code>osmium tags-filter norway-latest.osm.pbf w/highway w/public_transport=platform w/railway=platform w/park_ride=yes r/type=restriction -o norway-filtered.osm.pbf -f pbf,add_metadata=false,pbf_dense_nodes=true</code></p> <p>Be sure to move the original unfiltered file out of your graph inputs directory (or rename it with a suffix like <code>norway-latest.osm.pbf.ignore</code>) otherwise OTP2 will try to include both the filtered and unfiltered OSM data in your graph.</p> <p>The <code>build-config.json</code> for a Norwegian graph using Netex data looks like this:</p> <pre><code>{\n\"areaVisibility\": true,\n\"platformEntriesLinking\": true,\n\"islandWithoutStopsMaxSize\": 5,\n\"islandWithStopsMaxSize\": 5,\n\"dataImportReport\": true,\n\"netexDefaults\" : {\n\"moduleFilePattern\" : \".*-netex\\\\.zip\",\n\"sharedFilePattern\": \"_stops.xml\",\n\"sharedGroupFilePattern\": \"_(\\\\w{3})(_flexible)?_shared_data.xml\",\n\"groupFilePattern\": \"(\\\\w{3})_.*\\\\.xml\",\n\"feedId\": \"EN\",\n\"ferryIdsNotAllowedForBicycle\": [\n\"NYC:Line:1\",\n\"NYC:Line:012fc5c4-131b-4dfc-8160-4e49136e531a\",\n\"NYC:Line:8bfef12a-ac98-4376-8a2a-eb5a336d107b\"\n]\n},\n\"osm\": [\n{\n\"source\": \"norway-latest.osm.pbf\",\n\"osmTagMapping\": \"norway\",\n\"timeZone\": \"Europe/Oslo\"\n}\n]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note the special section specifying how to find Netex XML files within the single ZIP archive you downloaded.</p> <p>Once you have the graph inputs (the OSM PBF file, the Netex ZIP file, and the <code>build-config.json</code>) saved together in a directory, you can instruct OTP2 to build a graph from these inputs:</p> <p><code>java -Xmx10G otp2.jar --build --save /path/to/graph/inputs</code></p> <p>This should produce a file <code>graph.obj</code> in the same directory as your inputs. Building this Norway graph takes approximately 16 minutes (without elevation data, as configured above), and can be done within 10GB of heap memory (JVM switch <code>-Xmx10G</code>). Increasing that to 12 or 14GB might speed it up a bit if you have the space. The Graph file it produces is just under 600MB. The server will take about 30 seconds to load this Graph and start up, and will consume about 4GB of heap memory under light use.</p> <p>You can then start up an OTP server with a command like this:</p> <p><code>java -Xmx6G otp2.jar --load /path/to/graph</code></p> <p>Once the server is started up, go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in a browser to try out your server using OTP's built in testing web client. Try some long trips like Oslo to Bergen and see if you can get long distance trains and flights as alternatives. You might need to increase the walking limit above its very low default value.</p>"},{"location":"Netex-Norway/#adding-siri-realtime-data","title":"Adding SIRI Realtime Data","text":"<p>Another important feature in OTP2 is the ability to use SIRI realtime data.

You'll often need to download an extract for a country or region larger than your true analysis area, then cut it down to size.</p> <p>Excessively large OSM data can lead to significant increases in computation time and complexity, both while building the graph and handling trip planning requests. You may want to crop the OSM data if they cover an area significantly larger than your transit network. Several command line tools are able to perform these cropping operations: Osmosis is a multi-platform Java tool that works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS but is relatively slow, OSMConvert is a fast tool pre-built for Windows and Linux and available on MacOS and Linux distributions as part of <code>osmctools</code> package. Osmium-Tool is a personal favorite that is extremely fast but only straightforward to install on Linux and MacOS platforms. Below are some example crop commands for these different tools:</p> <p> Osmosis: <code>osmosis --rb input.osm.pbf --bounding-box left=4.34 right=5.84 bottom=43.10 top=43.97 --wb cropped.osm.pbf</code></p> <p> OsmConvert: <code>osmconvert input.osm.pbf -b=-77.255859375,38.77764022307335,-76.81365966796875,39.02345139405933 --complete-ways -o=cropped.osm.pbf</code></p> <p> Osmium: <code>osmium extract --strategy complete_ways --bbox 2.25,48.81,2.42,48.91 input.osm.pbf -o cropped.osm.pbf</code></p> <p>The latter two commands expect bounding boxes to be specified in the format <code>min_lon,min_lat,max_lon,max_lat</code>. We frequently find bounding boxes using the convenient Klokantech bounding box tool.

As of this writing, according to TagInfo 59% of the ways in OSM are buildings, and only 23% are roads or paths. Buildings frequently have more complex shapes than roads, and objects like waterways or political boundaries can be very large in size. It has been jokingly said that OSM should be renamed \"OpenBuildingMap\" rather than \"OpenStreetMap\".</p> <p>Removing unneeded data will reduce file sizes, facilitating copying or moving files around and reducing the size of project backups and archives. It may also speed up the processing stage where the OSM data is converted into a routable street network. Several command line tools exist to filter OSM data. Command line tools for this purpose include Osmosis and Osmium-Tool. Osmium-Tool is extremely fast but is only straightforward to install on Linux and MacOS platforms. Osmosis is often slower at filtering but will also work on Windows as it's a multi-platform Java application. OSMFilter cannot work with PBF format files so we rarely use it. Below are some example commands for retaining only OSM data useful for accessibility analysis.

Research and development on higher performance routing has been ongoing since 2013-2014, and work on the second major release referred to as OTP2 officially began in 2018. As of Q3 2020, a release candidate of OTP2 is available and in limited production use. This page explains key differences between the two versions (referred to as OTP1 and OTP2) to help you decide which one to use.</p> <p>OTP1 has existed for over a decade and is in widespread use. It aims to do many things for many people: it provides passenger-facing itinerary services over APIs, but also serves as a network analysis toolkit for urban planning and research. Though OTP1 is widely used and gets the job done, its transit routing approach is obsolete. We have long recognized that more resource-efficient approaches were possible. Reasonable response times and scaling to larger data sets have been achieved through a series of complex incremental interventions that became difficult to maintain. OTP1 has also accumulated large amounts of experimental code and specialized tools, which can be useful in a research or consulting setting but complicate long-term maintenance.</p> <p>OTP2 is brand new and still in testing, though based on code and ideas in heavy use for over five years. It offers much better performance in larger transportation networks and geographic areas, and a wider variety of alternative itineraries. OTP2's public transit routing component has been completely rewritten, and is now distinct from bike, walk, and motor vehicle routing. Non-transit routing remains identical to OTP1, benefiting from years of adaptations to nuances of OpenStreetMap data and end-user walking and biking preferences. Unlike OTP1, OTP2 is completely focused on passenger-facing itinerary services. The innovations in OTP2 have already been applied to planning, research, and analysis work for several years through Conveyal's R5 project, which informed and inspired the OTP2 transit routing system.</p> <p>OTP2 will not supersede OTP1 immediately for all use cases. In some situations there are legitimate reasons to continue using OTP1, or even for new OpenTripPlanner users to adopt OTP1 instead of OTP2. As development work continues over 2021 and additional 2.x releases are made, we expect this gap to close and OTP2 (in combination with other projects) may eventually fully replace OTP1, but this process is expected to take a few years.</p>"},{"location":"Version-Comparison/#otp2-use-cases","title":"OTP2 Use Cases","text":"<p>The benefits of OTP2 will be most evident in large or dense networks spanning multiple cities: entire countries (Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway), US states, metropolitan regions and cross-border conurbations (e.g. NYC metro area). Although the scale of trip planners is sometimes limited by the geographic extent of administrative structures (national rail or bus operators or ticketing agencies), OTP2 should be capable of handling even larger networks, and we do for example regularly test on a unified Nordic trip planner in hopes that such systems will materialize over time as more territories adopt OTP.</p> <p>OTP2 development has been driven by adoption of open source routing software in Northern Europe. Importantly for deployments in Europe, OTP2 introduces support for EU-standard Netex and SIRI data sources in addition to GTFS. The Nordic profile of Netex understood by OTP2 uses the same schema as the EU profile, and generalization to the EU profile should be feasible once it is standardized.</p>"},{"location":"Version-Comparison/#choosing-between-otp1-and-otp2","title":"Choosing between OTP1 and OTP2","text":"<p>Much development effort has gone into OTP2, and most OTP development effort will continue to focus on OTP2 after its release. OTP2 is much more efficient than OTP1 for certain common use cases, providing faster responses for a larger number of simultaneous users over larger geographic areas and more complex transportation networks.</p> <p>However, this does not mean that all users of OpenTripPlanner should switch to OTP2, or that all new users will want to start with OTP2. As of fall 2020, OTP1 remains much more widely used than OTP2, and most importantly OTP2 has a smaller feature set than OTP1. That is to say, OTP2 can do less things than OTP1, but it does them much more efficiently and tries to cover the most common use cases for large-scale OTP deployments.</p> <p>When in doubt, new users are advised to try out OTP2 and switch to OTP1 if they need features that are not available in OTP2. If some feature you need is missing from OTP2, you can also create a new issue or comment on an existing one on GitHub, letting us know why it is important to you.

We consider these use cases quite important. This has been a major area of application for OpenTripPlanner and has helped popularize cumulative opportunities accessibility metrics. For example, the University of Minnesota Accessibility Observatory used OpenTripPlanner for Access Across America. Nonetheless, the analysis code in OTP1 is essentially an unmaintained and unsupported early prototype for later projects, specifically Conveyal's R5 (and the Conveyal Analysis system built upon it). OTP1 seems to have gained popularity for analysis uses due to the existence of documentation and an active user community, but has significant technical shortcomings. One of these is simply speed: OTP1 can be orders of magnitude slower (and more memory-intensive) than the approaches exemplified in R5. The other is the requirement to search at a single specific time. Travel times and especially wait times on scheduled transit vary greatly depending on when you depart. Accounting for variation over a time window requires repeated independent searches at each possible departure time, which is very inefficient. R5 is highly optimized to capture variations in travel time across time windows and account for uncertainty in waiting times on frequency-based routes.</p> <p>Due to its similarity to the R5 approach, OTP2's transit router would not have these same problems. Nonetheless, we have decided not to port the OTP1 analysis features over to OTP2 since it would broaden the focus away from passenger information and draw finite attention away from existing projects like R5 and Conveyal Analysis.</p> <p>Accordingly, we have made an effort to clean up and augment OTP1 analysis documentation for researchers who will continue to need it. It should remain possible for people to continue using OTP1 if they prefer. If you would instead like to apply the innovations present in OTP2, we recommend looking into R5 or Conveyal Analysis.</p>"},{"location":"Version-Comparison/#routers-api-and-hot-reloading","title":"Routers API and Hot Reloading","text":"<p>Via it's Routers API, OTP1 allows loading data and serving APIs for multiple separate geographic areas.

This system also allows reloading transportation network data when it changes, or even pushing new data over a network connection.</p> <p>These were all adaptations to the very different IT environment that existed earlier in OTP history. These days, containerization and on-demand cloud servers have become ubiquitous, and most users solve these problems in totally different ways - by provisioning and starting up entirely new virtual servers, then switching a load balancer over to those new servers.

We will probably support the REST API for a long time to allow everyone to migrate to the new GraphQL API. Today, OTP2 comes with two Sandbox extension APIs:</p> <ul> <li>HSL Legacy GraphQL API - HSL's GraphQL API used by the Digitransit   project.</li> <li>Transmodel API - Entur\u00b4s Transmodel API</li> </ul> <p>The plan is to merge the two APIs above, clean it up and make it the new official API. The HSL API uses GTFS terminology, while the Entur API is Transmodel(NeTEx) based. Both APIs are similar in semantics/structure and provide the same functionality.

The only exception is elevation data, which can be loaded from AWS S3 as well. In OTP2, all data access is through an abstraction layer. This can be configured to support individual local files, zip files, and Google Cloud Storage. The new data access treats directories and zip files as \u201cequal\u201d, and this functionality is used to read the contents of GTFS and NeTEx archives. Other data sources can be supported by writing plugins. Entur has written a plugin for AWS S3 which has not been merged.
