For example, the University of Minnesota Accessibility Observatory used OpenTripPlanner for Access Across America. </p> <p>Although we consider these use cases quite important, most work of this kind has long since shifted to separate projects focused on urban planning and analytics.

OTP1 seems to have gained popularity for analysis uses due to the existence of documentation and an active user community, but has significant technical shortcomings. One of these is simply speed: OTP1 can be orders of magnitude slower (and more memory-intensive) than the approaches used in R5. The other is the requirement to search at a single specific time. Travel times and especially wait times on scheduled transit vary greatly depending on when you depart. Accounting for variation over a time window requires repeated independent searches at each possible departure time, which is very inefficient. R5 is highly optimized to capture variations in travel time across time windows and account for uncertainty in waiting times on frequency-based routes.</p>"},{"location":"Analysis/#travel-time-analysis-in-otp2","title":"Travel Time Analysis in OTP2","text":"<p>OTP2's new transit router is quite similar to R5 (indeed it was directly influenced by R5) and would not face the same technical problems. Nonetheless, we have decided not to port the OTP1 analysis features over to OTP2 since it would broaden the scope of OTP2 away from passenger information and draw the finite amount of available attention and resources away from existing open source analytics tools. If you would like to apply the routing innovations present in OTP2 in analytics situations, we recommend taking a look at projects like R5 or the R and Python language wrappers for it created by the community.</p>"},{"location":"Analysis/#terminology-note","title":"Terminology Note","text":"<p>In OpenTripPlanner, we usually use the term \"accessibility\" with its most common meaning: design of products, devices, services, vehicles, or environments to ensure they are usable by people with disabilities. The term \"accessibility\" has a completely separate, unrelated definition in the fields of spatial analysis, urban transportation planning, and associated social sciences, where it refers to quantitative indicators of how well-connected a particular location is to people or opportunities. OTP has been widely used in research and planning settings for the calculation of such indicators. Although this meaning of the term dates back many decades, it is less well known and has become a source of confusion, so the academic and planning communities are gradually shifting to the expression \"access to opportunities\", often shortened to \"access\".</p>"},{"location":"Basic-Tutorial/","title":"OpenTripPlanner Basic Tutorial","text":"<p>This page should allow you to set up and test your own OTP2 server.

There's an excellent description of the GTFS format here. Transport agencies throughout the world provide GTFS schedules to the public. Transitland has a registry of feeds and TransitFeeds also provides an extensive catalog. The best option is often to simply fetch the data directly from a transit operator or agency. If you know of a feed you want to work with, download it and put it in an empty directory you have created for your OTP instance such as <code>/home/username/otp</code> on Linux, <code>/Users/username/otp</code> on MacOS, or <code>C:\\Users\\username\\otp</code> on Windows. For OTP2 to detect a GTFS file, its name must end in <code>.zip</code> and must contain the letters 'gtfs'. We often use the convention of saving GTFS files with names ending in <code>.gtfs.zip</code> which meets both these criteria, reflecting the fact that a GTFS feed is just a ZIP file containing a specific set of files. If you don't have a particular feed in mind, the one for Portland, Oregon's TriMet agency is a good option. It is available at this URL. This is a moderate-sized input of good quality (TriMet initiated OTP development and helped develop the GTFS format). On Linux, this could be done on the command line as follows:</p> <pre><code>$ cd /home/username\n$ mkdir otp\n$ cd otp\n$ wget \"http://developer.trimet.org/schedule/gtfs.zip\" -O trimet.gtfs.zip\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Basic-Tutorial/#osm-for-streets","title":"OSM for Streets","text":"<p>You'll also need OpenStreetMap data to build a road network for walking, cycling, and driving. OpenStreetMap is a global collaborative map database that rivals or surpasses the quality of commercial maps in many locations. Several services extract smaller geographic regions from this database. Interline Technologies maintains a collection of extracts updated daily for urban areas around the world . Geofabrik provides extracts for larger areas like countries or states, from which you can prepare your own smaller bounding-box extracts using Osmosis , osmconvert, or (our favorite) Osmium-Tool. There is also Protomaps which can create custom extracts  for any region of the world with an easy to use drag and drop interface. OSM data can be delivered as XML or in the more compact binary PBF format. OpenTripPlanner consumes only PBF because it's smaller and more efficient.</p> <p>Download OSM PBF data for the same geographic region as your GTFS feed, and place this PBF file in the same directory you created for the OSM data. If you are using the TriMet GTFS feed, you could download the Geofabrik extract for the US state of Oregon , then further trim that to just the TriMet service area using the bounding box switch of one of the above tools. On Linux or MacOS you could do that as follows:</p> <pre><code>$ cd /home/username\n$ wget http://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us/oregon-latest.osm.pbf\n$ osmconvert oregon-latest.osm.pbf -b=-123.043,45.246,-122.276,45.652 --complete-ways -o=portland.pbf\n$ mv portland.pbf otp\n</code></pre> <p>We find this tool useful for determining the geographic coordinates of bounding boxes. The CSV option in that tool produces exactly the format expected by the <code>osmconvert -b</code> switch. The <code>--complete-ways</code> switch is important to handle roads that cross outside your bounding box.</p> <p>If you have extracted a smaller PBF file from a larger region, be sure to put only your extract (not the original larger file) in the directory with your GTFS data. Otherwise OTP will try to load both the original file and the extract in a later step. See the page on preparing OSM data for additional information and example commands for cropping and filtering OSM data.</p>"},{"location":"Basic-Tutorial/#starting-otp","title":"Starting OTP","text":"<p>A typical command to start OTP looks like <code>java -Xmx2G -jar otp.shaded.jar &lt;options&gt;</code>. The <code>-Xmx</code> parameter sets the limit on how much memory OTP is allowed to consume. GTFS and OSM data sets are often very large, and OTP is relatively memory-hungry. You will need at least 1GB of memory when working with the Portland TriMet data set, and several gigabytes for larger inputs. Here is more information about the system requirements. If you have sufficient memory in your computer, set this to a couple of gigabytes (e.g. <code>-Xmx2G</code>). Java uses a garbage collection approach to memory management, which requires some \"breathing room\" to efficiently operate. Without sufficient free memory OTP can grind to a halt. VisualVM is a good way to inspect Java memory usage, especially with the VisualGC plugin.</p>"},{"location":"Basic-Tutorial/#building-graphs","title":"Building Graphs","text":"<p>There are two main phases to preparing and deploying an OTP server. The first is to analyze the GTFS, OSM and any other inputs (such as elevation data) and build a representation of the transportation network. Following mathematical terminology we call this a 'graph', and refer to this phase as \"graph building\". The second phase is to start a server that provides trip planning and other API services for this graph.</p> <p>It is possible to save the graph to a file on disk after the first phase, then load the graph from the file in the second phase. This allows restarting the server or starting multiple instances of the server without repeating the often time-consuming process of building the graph. It is also possible to split the graph building process into separate OSM and GTFS stages for similar reasons: to allow reusing results from slow processes, such as applying elevation data to streets. These different options are controlled with command line switches, and will be described in more detail below and in other tutorials.</p>"},{"location":"Basic-Tutorial/#simple-one-step-server","title":"Simple One-step Server","text":"<p>The simplest way to use OTP is to build a graph in a single step and start a server immediately, without saving it to disk. The command to do so is:</p> <pre><code>$ java -Xmx2G -jar otp-2.6.0-shaded.jar --build --serve /home/username/otp\n</code></pre> <p>where <code>/home/username/otp</code> should be the directory where you put your configuration and input files.</p> <p>If you're using the Portland input data, the graph build operation should take about one minute to complete, and then you'll see a <code>Grizzly server running</code> message. At this point you have an OpenTripPlanner server running locally and can open http://localhost:8080/ in a web browser. You should be presented with a Javascript client application that will interact with your local OpenTripPlanner instance.</p> <p>This map-based user interface is in fact sending HTTP GET requests to the OTP server running on your local machine. It can be informative to watch the HTTP requests and responses being generated using the developer tools in your web browser. OTP's built-in web server will run by default on port 8080. If by any chance some other software is already using that port number, you can specify a different port number with a switch <code>--port 8801</code>.</p>"},{"location":"Basic-Tutorial/#saving-a-graph","title":"Saving a Graph","text":"<p>If you want speed up the process of repeatedly starting up a server with the same graph, you can build a graph from street and transit data then save it to a file using the <code>--build</code> and <code>--save</code> command line parameters together. If for example your current working directory (<code>.</code>) contains the input files and the OTP JAR file, you can use this command:</p> <pre><code>$ java -Xmx2G -jar otp-2.6.0-shaded.jar --build --save .\n</code></pre> <p>This will produce a file called <code>graph.obj</code> in the same directory as the inputs. The server can then be started later using the <code>--load</code> parameter, and will read this file instead of building the graph from scratch:</p> <pre><code>$ java -Xmx2G -jar otp-2.6.0-shaded.jar --load .\n</code></pre> <p>Another reason to perform these two phases separately is that the building process loads the entire GTFS and OSM data sets into memory, so can require significantly more memory than just running a server. Accordingly, you may want to perform the build on one machine (e.g. a throw-away cloud instance with more memory or compute capacity), then copy the resulting graph file to one or more smaller machines to serve the API.</p>"},{"location":"Basic-Tutorial/#layering-gtfs-onto-osm","title":"Layering GTFS onto OSM","text":"<p>Building the street graph (especially with elevation data) can take a long time.

Walk+Transit or Bike+Transit trips are planned using A-star with the Tung-Chew heuristic (i.e. a graph grown backward from the destination providing a lower bound on aggregate weight) for queue ordering.

On the other hand, OTP will waste resources if a service end date is unbounded or very large (<code>9999-12-31</code>). To avoid this, limit the OTP service period. Also, if you provide a service with multiple feeds they may have different service end dates. To avoid inconsistent results, the period can be limited, so all feeds have data for the entire period. The default is to use a period of 1 year before, and 3 years after the day the graph is built. Limiting the period will not improve the search performance, but OTP will build faster and load faster in most cases.</p> <p>The <code>transitServiceStart</code> and <code>transitServiceEnd</code> parameters are set using an absolute date like <code>2020-12-31</code> or a period like <code>P1Y6M5D</code> relative to the graph build date.

At a global scale sea level is represented as a surface called the geoid, which is irregular in shape due to local gravitational anomalies. On the other hand, GPS elevations are reported relative to the WGS84 spheroid, a perfectly smooth mathematical surface approximating the geoid. In cases where the two elevation definitions are mixed, it may be necessary to adjust elevation values to avoid confusing users with things like negative elevation values in places clearly above sea level. See issue #2301 for detailed discussion of this.</p> <p>OTP allows you to adjust the elevation values reported in API responses in two ways. The first way is to store ellipsoid (GPS) elevation values internally, but apply a single geoid difference value in the OTP client where appropriate to display elevations above sea level. This ellipsoid to geoid difference is returned in each trip plan response in the ElevationMetadata field. Using a single value can be sufficient for smaller OTP deployments, but might result in incorrect values at the edges of larger OTP deployments. If your OTP instance uses this, it is recommended to set a default request value in the <code>router-config.json</code> file as follows:</p> <pre><code>// router-config.json\n{\n    \"routingDefaults\": {\n        \"geoidElevation\": true   \n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The second way is to precompute these geoid difference values at a more granular level and store all elevations internally relative to the geoid (sea level). Elevations returned in the API responses will then not need to be adjusted to match end users' intuitive understanding of elevation. In order to speed up calculations, these geoid difference values are calculated and cached using only 2 significant digits of GPS coordinates. This is more than enough detail for most regions of the world and should result in less than one meter of vertical error even in areas that have the largest geoid irregularities. To enable this, include the following in the <code>build-config.json</code> file:</p> <pre><code>// build-config.json\n{\n  \"includeEllipsoidToGeoidDifference\": true\n}\n</code></pre> <p>If the geoid difference values are precomputed, be careful to not set the routing resource value of <code>geoidElevation</code> to true in order to avoid having the graph-wide geoid added again to all elevation values in the relevant street edges in responses.</p>"},{"location":"BuildConfiguration/#other-raster-elevation-data","title":"Other raster elevation data","text":"<p>For other parts of the world you will need a GeoTIFF file containing the elevation data.

In reality many kinds of clients are possible, not all of them being user interfaces (UIs). The OpenTripPlanner API may be called by various scripts and microservices, potentially all within what would traditionally be called a \"backend\" with no user interface at all.

The primary purpose of debug frontends is to allow OTP developers (as well as people evaluating OpenTripPlanner for their organization) to observe, test, and debug an OTP instance they're working on. Debug frontends will expose some internal details of OTP operation such as graph nodes and edges, traversal permissions, or transit data entity identifiers. Their primary role is as a development and deployment tool.</p> <p>On the other hand, production frontends are intended to be a component of larger public-facing deployments of OTP, with a more polished appearance and user experience. They generally do not work \"out of the box\", and require a significant amount of configuration and coordination with external components such as map tile servers and geocoders.

From 2009 through 2012, development was coordinated by New York nonprofit OpenPlans. In 2011 a second workshop was held to mark the end of the first phase of development. TriMet's 2009-2011 OTP Final Report summarizes progress at that point.</p> <p>The project has since grown to encompass a global community of users and developers. By early 2013, OpenTripPlanner had become the primary trip planning software used by TriMet in the Portland regional trip planner and was backing several popular mobile applications. Public-facing OpenTripPlanner instances were available in at least ten countries throughout the world. At this point the OpenPlans transportation software team became the independent consultancy Conveyal. The original OpenTripPlanner development team from OpenPlans still actively participates in programming, design, and community coordination via the mailing list and their roles on the OTP Project Leadership Committee.</p> <p>In summer of 2013, the OpenTripPlanner project was accepted for membership in the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC). SFC handles the legal and financial details common to many open source projects.</p> <p>In 2013-2014 OpenTripPlanner was a focal point in the Dutch Transport Ministry's Beter Benutten Multimodale Reisinformatie (Better Utilization: Multimodal Travel Information) project which encouraged investment in trip planning platforms and services. Five companies worked together to improve OpenTripPlanner performance in large regional transport networks and add support for streaming real-time data, making itineraries reflect service modifications and delays only seconds after vehicles report their positions. Another consortium embarked on a full rewrite of the trip planning core called RRRR (or R4), a proof of concept validating extremely efficient routing techniques and serving as an early prototype for OTP2.</p> <p>In the fall of 2014, Arlington, Virginia launched a new commute planning site for the Washington, DC metropolitan area, depending on OpenTripPlanner to weigh the costs and benefits of various travel options. In 2015 the New York State department of transportation's 511 transit trip planner began using OTP to provide itineraries for public transit systems throughout the state from a single unified OTP instance. Starting in early 2016, the regional transport authorities of Helsinki, Finland (HSL) and Oslo, Norway (Ruter) began using a completely open source passenger information system based on OpenTripPlanner.

Videos of the full April 2019 OTP summit and the October 2019 OTP webinar are available.</p> <p>OTP2 went into feature freeze in September 2020, and the 2.0 release occurred at the end of November 2020. OTP2 is now seeing production use for a subset of requests in several national-scale trip planners. The project leadership committee is exploring the creation of an OTP1 working group to ensure follow-up maintenance of the final version of OTP1.</p>"},{"location":"In-Station-Navigation/","title":"In-station navigation","text":"<p>OTP offers a variety of ways to produce precise walking instructions for walking inside a station or between transit stops.</p>"},{"location":"In-Station-Navigation/#osm-generated-navigation","title":"OSM generated navigation","text":"<p>In the most common case, the walking instructions for reaching a transit stop are generated from the available OSM data.

For example, true geographic islands are usually disconnected from the main graph. The street network of such islands should be kept so that routing within the island or continuing from a ferry stop on it works as expected. Even a tiny street network connected to a ferry stop improves routing to an island a lot, because coordinate based itinerary searches find something to project onto.</p> <p> Removing a small subgraph from an island causes poor routing. A ferry stop on the island links directly to mainland.</p> <p>Disconnected parts can also represent a strictly forbidden area, such as connections within an industrial unit, roads of a military base or another region which cannot and should not be accessed when using door to door routing of a public transit journey planner. Existence of such graph sections is harmful, because start and end points of an itinerary search request may accidentally get projected to such a private pathway. As a result, a user does not receive any itineraries and gets no explanation for the routing problem.</p> <p>In most cases, connectivity problems are caused by incorrect modeling of OSM data. The number of such errors is usually very large, and the problem cannot be solved by simply fixing OSM data as soon as errors are detected - the OSM street network in Finland contains over 10 000 detected walk connectivity issues! An algorithmic solution is needed to address a problem of such magnitude.</p> <p> A typical error: bus platforms are not connected to the street network at all</p> <p>A simple and efficient solution is to detect harmful disconnected parts and remove them from the street graph. Routing then uses the properly connected part of the graph and finds itineraries. As a side effect, the start point of an itinerary search which departs from the removed graph projects at the border of it, which usually is good enough. Transfers may include strange teleportation and unexpected walking, as public transit stops may link to somewhat remote streets, but at least transfers will work.</p> <p> A disconnected railway platform breaks routing. Traveler is guided to take a round trip around the country although there is one hour direct train connection.</p>"},{"location":"IslandPruning/#access-restriction-islands","title":"Access restriction islands","text":"<p>One common reason for OSM connectivity problems is access tagging. It is perfectly OK to tag a front yard of a private residence using <code>access=private</code> or <code>access=destination</code> tags, so that strangers are not guided to travel through the private area. Routing will still use the private streets if a trip starts or ends there - only pass through traversal gets prohibited. However, sometimes OSM contributors try to block the traffic by tagging only entrance segments of streets leading to a restricted area. Unfortunately this totally prevents access to the interior part of the network, because OTP interprets it as pass through traffic. Pruning handles such problems by converting streets behind an access restriction to have the same access properties.</p> <p> Some regular (gray colored) streets are blocked behind access restricted (red colored) connections. Walk routing to them fails because it would be considered as pass through traffic. The image on the right shows that pruning added walk nothrough restricition to those streets, and routing works again.</p>"},{"location":"IslandPruning/#pruning-algorithm","title":"Pruning algorithm","text":"<p>Pruning analyses the three traverse modes - walk, bike and car - separately. For example, a resting area by a motorway may include some walking paths, but the only way to get there is to use car. Therefore, it represents a disconnected 'island' when considering the walk mode. Pruning does not erase disconnected graph geometry as long as it can be reached using any of the traverse modes. Instead, pruning removes traversal permission for each disconnected mode from the island.</p> <p>Pruning uses four parameters and some heuristics to decide if a disconnected sub graph is a real island to be retained, or a harmful data error:</p> <ul> <li><code>islandWithStopsMaxSize</code> defines the threshold for graph islands, which include public transit stops. All stop islands which have less graph edges than this get pruned. Default value is 2.  </li> <li><code>islandWithoutStopsMaxSize</code> defines the threshold for graph islands, which do not have public transit stops. All stopless islands which have less edges than this get pruned. Defaults to 10.  </li> <li><code>adaptivePruningFactor</code> defines the maximal value for a distance based multiplier for the two thresholds defined above (default value 20).  </li> <li><code>adaptivePruningDistance</code> defines the search radius as meters when estimating distance between graphs (default value 250).  </li> </ul> <p>Pruning thresholds are increased adaptively so that if the distance between an examined sub graph and the other graph is zero, the threshold is multiplied by a full adaptivePruningFactor value. The idea is that if a sub graph is closely entangled with another graph, it is likely to be a harmful modeling error, not a remote place like a true geographic island. If the distance is more than <code>adaptivePruningDistance</code>, the actual nominal threshold values will be used. So, adaptiveness prunes much larger disconnected graphs in places where they have potential to cause routing errors.</p> <p>Adaptive pruning can be disabled by setting adaptivePruningFactor to 1. Constant pruning thresholds will then be applied.</p> <p>Pruning also examines the transport modes of graph islands with stops. If land transportation modes are not found (only ferry or no modes at all), the graph is retained. Unknown mode is accepted for island status, because ferry lines often operate only during warm seasons.</p>"},{"location":"IslandPruning/#some-examples","title":"Some examples","text":"<p> A disconnected small graph should be preserved, if it is located on a real island.</p> <p> A street section has tags which prevent traversal on it, and OTP has removed it from the graph. Some isolated streets remain left, and a public transit stop gets linked to them. Routing cannot use the stop unless traveler is leaving from or going to the small isolated sub graph. Isolated streets cannot be reached by walking either. After pruning, the stop is projected to the main graph. Transfers at the stop work fine. Itineraries can guide traveler quite close to the removed streets.</p> <p> The platform structure of a bus station is disconnected from the other graph. Most bus traffic of a medium size city becomes unusable. Despite of the complexity of the sub graph (54 edges and 21 stops), it must be removed in pruning, so that stops get linked to reachable and well connected streets.</p>"},{"location":"IslandPruning/#issue-reports","title":"Issue reports","text":"<p>Pruning creates a <code>GraphIsland</code> issue every time it prunes a sub graph.

Such islands are particularly harmful, because they are places where public transit transfers take place and hence are frequently used.

Netex is a European specification for transit data exchange, comparable in purpose to GTFS but broader in scope. An EU directive aims to have all EU countries sharing Netex data by the end of 2019.</p> <p>Different countries are currently using different incompatible \"profiles\" of Netex, but an effort is underway to converge on a single European standard profile. This is based in large part on the Norwegian profile, and Norway's national passenger information and ticketing agency Entur has contributed the OTP2 Netex loading code. Therefore if you'd like to try loading Netex data, Norway is a good place to start.</p> <p>The Norwegian Netex data can be downloaded from the Entur developer pages. There is a column of Netex download links partway down the page, and the first row is for all of Norway.</p> <p>Full OSM data for Norway can be downloaded from the Geofabrik Norway downloads page. Get the <code>norway-latest.osm.pbf</code> file, which can then be filtered to remove buildings and other unused data before loading into OTP using a command like the one below.

Building this Norway graph takes approximately 16 minutes (without elevation data, as configured above), and can be done within 10GB of heap memory (JVM switch <code>-Xmx10G</code>). Increasing that to 12 or 14GB might speed it up a bit if you have the space. The Graph file it produces is just under 600MB. The server will take about 30 seconds to load this Graph and start up, and will consume about 4GB of heap memory under light use.</p> <p>You can then start up an OTP server with a command like this:</p> <p><code>java -Xmx6G otp2.jar --load /path/to/graph</code></p> <p>Once the server is started up, go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in a browser to try out your server using OTP's built in testing web client. Try some long trips like Oslo to Bergen and see if you can get long distance trains and flights as alternatives.

While technically a distinct specification from Netex, both Netex and SIRI use the Transmodel vocabulary, allowing SIRI messages to reference entities in Netex schedule data. Like GTFS-RT, SIRI is consumed by OTP2 using \"graph updaters\" which are configured in the <code>router-config.json</code> file, which is placed in the same directory as the <code>graph.obj</code> file and loaded at server startup.</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"updaters\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"siri-sx-updater\",\n            \"frequency\": \"1m\",\n            \"url\": \"https://api.example.com/siri\",\n            \"feedId\": \"siri-sx\",\n            \"blockReadinessUntilInitialized\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"siri-et-updater\",\n            \"frequency\": \"20s\",\n            \"previewIntervalMinutes\": 180,\n            \"url\": \"https://api.example.com/siri\",\n            \"feedId\": \"siri-et\",\n            \"blockReadinessUntilInitialized\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"siri-vm-updater\",\n            \"frequency\": \"1m\",\n            \"url\": \"https://api.example.com/siri\",\n            \"feedId\": \"siri-vm\",\n            \"blockReadinessUntilInitialized\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"raptor-transit-layer\",\n            \"updateIntervalSeconds\": 20\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The first three updaters fetch three different kinds of SIRI data:</p> <ul> <li>Situation Exchange (SX, text notices analogous to GTFS-RT Alerts)</li> <li>Estimated Timetable (ET, predicted arrival times analogous to GTFS-RT TripUpdates)</li> <li>Vehicle Monitoring (VM, location and status of vehicles analogous to GTFS-RT VehiclePositions)</li> </ul> <p>These updaters can handle differential updates, but they use a polling approach rather than the message-oriented streaming approach of the GTFS-RT Websocket updater. The server keeps track of clients, sending only the things that have changed since the last polling operation.</p> <p>Note that between these SIRI updaters and the GTFS-RT Websocket updater, we now have both polling and streaming examples of GTFS-RT \"incrementality\" semantics, so should be able to finalize that part of the specification.</p> <p>The final updater regularly performs a copy of the real-time data into a format suitable for use by OTP2's new Raptor router.

You may want to crop the OSM data if they cover an area significantly larger than your transit network.

The transfer optimization ensures that transfers occur at the best possible location.

For example, a rule looks like this:</p> <pre><code>props.setProperties(\"highway=track\", StreetTraversalPermission.ALL, 1.3, 1.3);\n</code></pre> <p>This means that an OSM way with the tag <code>highway=track</code> is traversable by all modes (pedestrian, bicycle, car) and that its bicycle safety score when you traverse in order of the way is <code>1.3</code> and also <code>1.3</code> when going the other way (smaller means more cycle-friendly).</p> <p>If there is a more specific matcher like <code>highway=track;bicycle=no</code> and it matches a given OSM way, it is chosen instead and its settings applied.</p> <p>The score can be any positive number but the range (as of writing this) goes from <code>0.6</code> for bike lanes to <code>100</code> for ways that consist of sand. To figure out a good value for your set of tags you should read the bicycle safety report (see below) or the source code of your <code>OsmTagMapper</code> to get a feeling for how much certain tags are penalised or rewarded.</p> <p>There are also so-called mixins.

As of Q3 2023, OTP2 is the only version to receive regular updates and OTP1 is considered legacy and unsupported. This page explains  key differences between the two versions (referred to as OTP1 and OTP2). </p> <p>OTP1 has existed for over a decade and is in widespread use. It aims to do many things for many people: it provides passenger-facing itinerary services over APIs, but also serves as a network analysis toolkit for urban planning and research. Though OTP1 is widely used and gets the job done, its transit routing approach is obsolete. We have long recognized that more resource-efficient approaches were possible. Reasonable response times and scaling to larger data sets have been achieved through a series of complex incremental interventions that became difficult to maintain. OTP1 has also accumulated large amounts of experimental code and specialized tools, which can be useful in a research or consulting setting but complicate long-term maintenance.</p> <p>OTP2 offers much better performance in larger transportation networks and geographic areas, and a wider variety of alternative itineraries. OTP2's public transit routing component has been completely rewritten, and is now distinct from bike, walk, and motor vehicle routing. Non-transit routing remains very similar to OTP1, benefiting from years of adaptations to nuances of OpenStreetMap data and end-user walking and biking preferences. Unlike OTP1, OTP2 is completely focused on passenger-facing itinerary services. The innovations in OTP2 have already been applied to planning, research, and analysis work for several years through Conveyal's R5 project, which informed and inspired the OTP2 transit routing system.</p>"},{"location":"Version-Comparison/#otp2-use-cases","title":"OTP2 Use Cases","text":"<p>The benefits of OTP2 will be most evident in large or dense networks spanning multiple cities: entire countries (Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway), US states, metropolitan regions and cross-border conurbations (e.g. NYC metro area).

Importantly for deployments in Europe, OTP2 introduces support for EU-standard Netex and SIRI data sources in addition to GTFS.

This system also allows reloading transportation network data when it changes, or even pushing new data over a network connection.</p> <p>These were all adaptations to the very different IT environment that existed earlier in OTP history. These days, containerization and on-demand cloud servers have become ubiquitous, and most users solve these problems in totally different ways - by provisioning and starting up entirely new virtual servers, then switching a load balancer over to those new servers. Because the Routers API is complex and exposes potentially damaging functionality over the network, it has been removed from OTP2 to simplify the code base and make it easier to reason about security.</p>"},{"location":"Version-Comparison/#routing-request-parameters","title":"Routing request parameters","text":"<p>Less parameters are available on the OTP2 REST API than in OTP1.

The only exception is elevation data, which can be loaded from AWS S3 as well. In OTP2, all data access is through an abstraction layer. This can be configured to support individual local files, zip files, and Google Cloud Storage. The new data access treats directories and zip files as \u201cequal\u201d, and this functionality is used to read the contents of GTFS and NeTEx archives. Other data sources can be supported by writing plugins. Entur has written a plugin for AWS S3 which has not been merged. If requested they can provide this code for AWS S3.</p> <p>Library upgrades We have adapted OTP2 to run on Java 11+ and moved to newer versions of some dependencies such as GraphQL and One Bus Away.</p> <p>Bugfixes At least bug issues have been resolved in OTP2.

That project required us to modify the original OTP quite a lot so we didn't propose our efforts for the community.</p> <p>With the OTP2 release we decided to create a dedicated layer on top of OTP2 which not only leaves the initial structure of the OpenTripPlanner intact, but also brings some additional features for those, who actually need them.
